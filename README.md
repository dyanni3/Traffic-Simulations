# Traffic-project

Traffic collaboration between Skanda Vivek, David Yanni, Jesse Silverberg, and Peter Yunker.

Data repository for recent preprint "Cyber-physical risks of hacked Internet connected vehicles"(under revision, Nature Communications)

Files:

1) idm.ipynb denotes contains code to simulate veihcular motion according to the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)

2) OSM+Manhattan.ipynb contains code to extract Manhattan street network information using OSMnX, and then analyze percolation via compromised vehicles

3) The folder grid-lights-lanes contains code for simulating dynamics on a 5x5 Manhattan-like grid using the SUMO package, and subsequent analysis

4) The rest of the codes are relavant to other projects (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03791)
